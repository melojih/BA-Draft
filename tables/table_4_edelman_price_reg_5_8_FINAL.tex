\caption*{\footnotesize Notes: This table presents the effect on price of controlling for Edelman \& Luca's (2014) full specification using my NYC data. My results are nearly identical to theirs (their coefficient on Black hosts was -17.8) when controlling for similar covariates in the same city. The omitted category for race is White hosts. The omitted category for room type is Entire Apartment. I could not control for host social media accounts as a proxy for host reliability like Edelman \& Luca did, because Airbnb no longer provides this information. Instead, I controlled for ``host verified", a boolean for whether Airbnb has the host's phone number and email. I was not able to control for ``picture quality" either, but picture quality did not significantly influence price in Edelman \& Luca's regression.}\\
