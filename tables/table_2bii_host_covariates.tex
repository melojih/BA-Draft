		\caption*{Notes: The values in the table are means and standard deviations of host-level data in the full sample. Summary statistics for selected covariates are listed in the table. Categorical variables such as response time do not have standard deviations. Statistics for only the most frequent response time (``within an hour") are included. White refers only to non-Hispanic whites. Length of ``Summary" and proportion of short words in the ``Summary'' refer to my constructed measures of host quality. These two measures were also calculated for the description, space, neighborhood overview, notes, and transit fields, but were not included in the table for the sake of clarity and because they follow a similar pattern as the ``Summary" field.}
